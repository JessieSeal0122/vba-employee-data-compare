# vba-employee-data-compare

This project automates the comparison of employee data between two worksheets using VBA.  
It detects duplicate Employee IDs, highlights mismatched fields, and generates a side-by-side results summary with color-coded formatting.

---

## 🧰 Features

- Duplicate detection:
  Checks for duplicate Employee IDs in both Raw data 1 and Raw data 2. If duplicates are found, the macro highlights the IDs in red and stops execution.
- Data comparison:
  If no duplicates are found, the macro continues to compare records by Employee ID across both sheets.
- Results output:
  Any mismatched records are written to a newly created or cleared Results worksheet with color-coded highlights.
- Field-level mismatch marking:
  Yellow fill is used to mark mismatched fields side-by-side for easy auditing.
- Clear user feedback:
  If differences exist: Shows "比對完成！結果已儲存到 'Results' 工作表。"
  If no differences: Shows "無變更資料"
